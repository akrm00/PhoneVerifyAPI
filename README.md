## Installation

### Using the Pre-Compiled `.exe` File

1. Locate the `main.exe` file in the project directory.
2. Run the `.exe` file to start the application immediately without installing Python or any dependencies.

### Using Python

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhoneVerifyAPI.git
   cd PhoneVerifyAPI
   ```

2. Install the required Python package:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter requests
   ```

3. Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your system.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application:** Start the program using either the `.exe` file or the `main.py` script.

2. **Enter API Key:** Obtain an API key from [NumVerify.com](https://numverify.com) and input it into the application.

3. **Load a File:** Use the **Load File** button to select a text file containing phone numbers (one number per line).

4. **Start Verification:** Click the **Start** button to begin validating the numbers. The results will be displayed in real-time.

5. **Export Results:** Valid phone numbers will be automatically saved to `output.txt` in the application directory.

## Phone Number Format

Phone numbers should be provided in international format for accurate validation. For example:
```
+14155552671
+919876543210
+442071838750
+15146783499
```

## How It Works

1. **API Request:** Each phone number is validated by sending a request to the NumVerify API.
2. **Response Handling:** The application processes the API's response to determine validity.
3. **Real-Time Feedback:** The GUI updates in real-time with the progress and results.

## Notes

- Ensure your NumVerify API key is active and has sufficient credits for the number of requests you plan to make.
- The application requires an active internet connection for API communication.
- Invalid or improperly formatted numbers will be ignored.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for additional phone number validation APIs.
- Include more detailed error messages for failed verifications.
- Optimize multithreading for even faster processing.
